Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences Systemo project

This is an open source project using Intel Galileo and Arduino development boards to create an automated parking space
monitoring system for small to medium sized garages.

Use "slave"-code with Arduino board to manage ultrasonic sensor signals and send them to "master"-device Galileo for
handling and monitoring. The boards communicate over I2C-connection.
